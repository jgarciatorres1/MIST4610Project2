Description of dataset:

Our dataset details the homelessness in California. We drew our dataset through this site (People Receiving Homeless Response Services by Age, Race, Ethnicity, and Gender - Catalog (data.gov)). This dataset encapsulates data from all 44 California Continuums of Care (CoC)â€”regional homelessness service coordination through their outreach and prevention programs. Our dataset is composed of various dimensions that require various data types. It includes specific data points such as gender, race, age, specific Californian regions, and homelessness from 2017 through 2023. All of these dimensions except for year and quantity are text data types. Year and quantity data types are both INT. Additionally, this data tracks age homelessness count, gender homelessness count, and race homelessness count which are all INT data types. These counts return the number of individuals who are homeless in each group. All in all, this dataset has a variety of diverse dimensions that help us closely analyze the homelessness in California.

Question 1:

Question: What is the distribution of homelessness in California across age groups, and how does it vary by gender?

Importance:

Understanding the distribution of homelessness across different age groups, along with changes by gender, is crucial for developing targeted and effective interventions to address the specific needs of diverse demographic segments. By identifying which age groups are facing the most significant struggles with homelessness, policymakers and social organizations can tailor their strategies to provide more tailored and impactful support.

Our first bar chart graph illustrates the count of homeless individuals that occur within California based by gender and age groups. We noticed that the young age group of male, female, transgender and unknown individuals between the ages of 18-24 and 18 under disproportionately faced the most issues with homelessness.

We then experimented with exploring a specific age group across the 2017-2023 timeline. We noticed there was an increase in homelessness in individuals 65 and older. This leads us to a larger conclusion that there could be a significant increase in the aging population and therefore may be a corresponding increase in the number of seniors experiencing homelessness.

Question 2:

Question: What race tends to experience more homelessness? And for that race, what age groups are most affected?

Importance:

Understanding the racial disparities in homelessness is very important for addressing systemic inequities faced by different communities. By identifying the race that is most affected, policymakers and other advocates can develop plans to intervene and address the root problems and provide more effective and efficient support. The different cultural backgrounds of homeless individuals and the traditions and customs they get used to growing up in may all be factors that should be considered when looking at differences in the rates of homelessness, it can be very telling of how minorities and others are treated in California, and allows room for meaningful conversations where solutions can be implemented to mitigate the homeless rates amongst specific communities.

In the first graph we examined Homelessness just by race within the data. We observed that White Californians experience more homelessness compared to the other racial groups. However, American Indian, Alaska Natives, or Indigenous individuals in California follow not far behind. Meanwhile, Asian and Native Hawiian or Pacific Islanders have a lower count by almost half.

When adding age as a factor we can observe at what ages different racial groups in California experience different counts of homelessness. In our last chart we observed that White Californians experience a higher count of homelessness and the chart above expands on the ages and White Californians between the ages of 35-44(16,502), 45-54(16,328), and 55-64(15,869) have counts over 15,000. Only those with multiple Races between the ages of 18-24(15,993)and Black, African Americans between 55-64 (15,707) are the other groups who have counts of over 15,000. 

Manipulations applied to the data set for analysis:
We did not need to conduct any manipulations or calculations to the existing data. We went through our data and did not find any duplicates or redundancies within the data sets. We successfully conducted a quantitative analysis, allowing us to use the data into measurable and meaningful insights about the rates of homelessness within the state of California.
